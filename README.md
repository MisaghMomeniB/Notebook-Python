### 1. Importing Modules
```python
import sys
from PyQt5.QtWidgets import (
    QApplication, QMainWindow, QTextEdit, QMenuBar, QAction, QFileDialog, QMessageBox, QInputDialog
)
from PyQt5.QtGui import QFont, QIcon
from fpdf import FPDF
```
- `sys`: Provides access to some variables used or maintained by the Python interpreter.
- `PyQt5.QtWidgets`: Imports various widgets from PyQt5 to build the graphical interface (like windows, text areas, menus, etc.).
- `QFont`, `QIcon`: These classes are used to set fonts and icons for GUI elements.
- `FPDF`: A library for generating PDF documents in Python.

### 2. The Notebook Class
```python
class Notebook(QMainWindow):
    def __init__(self):
        super().__init__()
        self.current_theme = "light"  # Current theme, default is light
        self.init_ui()
```
- `Notebook`: This class inherits from `QMainWindow`, making it a window-based application.
- `self.current_theme`: Keeps track of the current theme (either light or dark). Initially, it's set to "light".
- `init_ui()`: A method that sets up the user interface (UI) of the application.

### 3. `init_ui` Method
```python
def init_ui(self):
    """
    Initializes the main user interface.
    Sets up the main window, text area, and menu bar.
    """
    self.setWindowTitle("Notebook")
    self.setGeometry(100, 100, 800, 600)
```
- Sets the window title as **"Notebook"**.
- The window is set to appear at position (100, 100) on the screen with a width of 800px and height of 600px.

### 4. Setting up the Text Area
```python
    self.text_area = QTextEdit(self)
    self.text_area.setFont(QFont("Arial", 14))
    self.setCentralWidget(self.text_area)
```
- `QTextEdit`: Creates a text area where users can input and edit text.
- The font for the text area is set to **Arial** with a font size of 14.
- `setCentralWidget(self.text_area)`: Makes the text area the central widget of the main window.

### 5. Applying the Theme (CSS)
```python
    self.apply_css("styles/light.css")
```
- `apply_css`: Applies a CSS file to style the application (set light theme by default).
  
### 6. Creating the Menu Bar
```python
    self.menu_bar = QMenuBar(self)
    self.setMenuBar(self.menu_bar)
    self.create_menus()
```
- `QMenuBar`: Creates a menu bar at the top of the window.
- `setMenuBar(self.menu_bar)`: Sets this menu bar to the main window.
- `create_menus()`: A method that will define and add menus and actions to the menu bar.

### 7. `create_menus` Method
```python
def create_menus(self):
    """
    Creates the menu bar and adds actions to the menus.
    """
```
- `create_menus`: This method defines all the menus (File, Edit, View, Font) and the actions for each.

### 8. File Menu Actions
```python
    file_menu = self.menu_bar.addMenu("File")
    
    new_action = QAction(QIcon("icons/new.png"), "New", self)
    new_action.triggered.connect(self.new_file)

    open_action = QAction(QIcon("icons/open.png"), "Open...", self)
    open_action.triggered.connect(self.open_file)
    
    save_action = QAction(QIcon("icons/save.png"), "Save...", self)
    save_action.triggered.connect(self.save_file)

    export_pdf_action = QAction(QIcon("icons/pdf.png"), "Export to PDF...", self)
    export_pdf_action.triggered.connect(self.export_to_pdf)

    exit_action = QAction("Exit", self)
    exit_action.triggered.connect(self.close)
```
- `QAction`: Creates an action for each menu item with an associated icon and text.
- **Triggering actions**: Each action is connected to a method (like `new_file`, `open_file`, etc.) that performs a specific function when the action is triggered.
- **Adding actions to file menu**: These actions (New, Open, Save, etc.) are added to the "File" menu.

### 9. Edit, View, and Font Menus
```python
    edit_menu = self.menu_bar.addMenu("Edit")
    find_action = QAction("Find...", self)
    find_action.triggered.connect(self.find_text)
    edit_menu.addAction(find_action)

    view_menu = self.menu_bar.addMenu("View")
    toggle_theme_action = QAction("Toggle Theme", self)
    toggle_theme_action.triggered.connect(self.toggle_theme)
    view_menu.addAction(toggle_theme_action)

    font_menu = self.menu_bar.addMenu("Font")
    change_font_action = QAction("Change to Courier", self)
    change_font_action.triggered.connect(self.change_font)
    font_menu.addAction(change_font_action)
```
- **Edit Menu**: Contains a "Find" action to search for specific text in the document.
- **View Menu**: Allows toggling between light and dark themes.
- **Font Menu**: Provides an option to change the text font to "Courier".

### 10. `apply_css` Method
```python
def apply_css(self, css_file):
    """
    Applies a CSS file to the application.
    """
    try:
        with open(css_file, "r") as file:
            self.setStyleSheet(file.read())
    except Exception as e:
        QMessageBox.critical(self, "Error", f"Could not load stylesheet:\n{e}")
```
- Reads a CSS file and applies it to the application using `setStyleSheet`.
- If the CSS file cannot be loaded, it displays an error message using `QMessageBox`.

### 11. File Actions Methods (New, Open, Save, Export)
- `new_file`: Clears the text area.
- `open_file`: Opens a file and loads its content into the text area.
- `save_file`: Saves the content of the text area to a file.
- `export_to_pdf`: Exports the content of the text area to a PDF file using `FPDF`.

### 12. Search and Change Font
- `find_text`: Searches for text in the document. Displays a dialog where the user can input the text to search.
- `change_font`: Changes the font of the text area to **Courier**.

### 13. Theme Toggle
```python
def toggle_theme(self):
    """
    Toggles between light and dark themes.
    """
    if self.current_theme == "light":
        self.apply_css("styles/dark.css")
        self.current_theme = "dark"
    else:
        self.apply_css("styles/light.css")
        self.current_theme = "light"
```
- Toggles the theme between light and dark by applying different CSS files (`light.css` or `dark.css`).

### 14. Running the Application
```python
if __name__ == "__main__":
    app = QApplication(sys.argv)
    notebook = Notebook()
    notebook.show()
    sys.exit(app.exec_())
```
- This block starts the application by creating an instance of `QApplication` and running the `Notebook` application window.
- The event loop is started with `app.exec_()`, keeping the window open and responsive until closed.

---

### Summary

- The app provides a basic text editor with file handling, search functionality, font changes, theme toggling, and PDF export.
- The GUI is structured with a menu bar allowing for intuitive navigation and user interaction.
